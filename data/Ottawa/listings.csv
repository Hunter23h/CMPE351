I'm Greg, Calgary born and happily transplanted to Ottawa. Educated and employed as an Economist,  I am also a trained Heritage Carpenter.  Owning and maintaining real estate is a passion of mine.  Giving back to the community is important to me and our business is a ""Champion of Hope"" financial donor for a local men's shelter in Ottawa, Ontario. 

Hi! I'm Valerie, and have been living in Ottawa for most of my life. My professional background is international development with a focus on finance and project management. I have toured the world - 200 cities in 61 countries - and I love to explore, travel, eat, cook and read.  My very first trip was to Haiti and my latest expedition was a fabulous  South African safari.  I am also a Personal Travel Designer and I love both five star journeys and budget backpacking.  My favourite poem is Invictus,  and I would describe myself as lucky, blessed, happy, a foodie, an early adopter, endlessly curious,  the wife of Greg and the mother of two fabulous daughters - who are global citizens.  

We feel very fortunate to be able to host so many wonderful guests in Ottawa. 

Cheers and hope to see you soon!

Glad you cruised by...

I live a life full of adventure, purpose, and laughs. 

I have enjoyed a diverse and eclectic career which has led me to where I am now...with the Ottawa Fire Department as my ""day"" job, CEO of a clean technology company as my passion job, and a stand up comic and Stadium MC/ Host for the Ottawa Redblacks CFL team as my part time jobs...and of course, being a Superhost to a unique AirBnB at my residence in Ottawa. 

While globetrotting over the past twenty years I discovered what works at an Airbnb and have curated my own space to be clean, comfortable, and convenient for my guests. My Airbnb meets the highest standards... my own. 

As a life long Ottawan I know the city like no one else. As a younger man I was the doorman at the Chateau Laurier (Ottawa's most iconic, historic hotel) where I learned the importance of guest service while attending to a VIP clientele of Canadian and international public figures. 

I am bilingual in French and English.

I have traveled the world performing stand up comedy.

I have worked with children affected by HIV.

I am, by virtue of cultural and familial upbringing, polite and considerate.

I am a huge proponent of the circular economy and offer a low-waste space at my BnB.

I am sure I will enjoy meeting you if you have read this far and are still reading.

Family is very important to me- I have two young boys aged 8 and 9 who keep me busy but more importantly teach me how to be a better person daily.

I never order food without checking with the locals for their faves and I rarely eat at chain food restaurants when there's a better local option. I would rather meet local people and get a sense of their community. I love to cook and with three kids & a husband to feed that's a good combination because boy, can they eat! Best vacations are family vacations. My teenagers still love to travel with us. I guess that says something about our travel adventures, and its a good thing! :) When we travel we make stops to see local curiosities and historic landmarks, often unplanned, screeching halt roadside and we pile out to check out a interesting relic or historic plaque/scene. I tidy a hotel room before I leave as if I was heading out of my own home and I tip the hotel staff. We love the theatre, live musical performances, animated kids movies, good local food and finding humour even in the worst of situations.
I love to meet new people and get to know them when I'm hosting, and I also respect their privacy or preference to be alone. I'm attentive to the guest's needs and like to accommodate as much as possible the guest's special requests.
My motto is do it now because someday I'll be sleeping the sleep of forever and I don't want to miss anything while I'm still here!",N/A,N/A,N/A,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fc9c81a9-bbcf-4d1b-8c16-bb19713611c4.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fc9c81a9-bbcf-4d1b-8c16-bb19713611c4.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,2,2,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",Cumberland,,45.49366,-75.46803,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,,1 shared bath,,1,[],$78.00,30,30,30,30,30,30,30.0,30.0,,t,29,59,89,89,2023-12-18,2,0,0,2019-06-24,2019-07-01,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,,f,2,0,2,0,0.04

Hi! I'm Valerie, and have been living in Ottawa for most of my life. My professional background is international development with a focus on finance and project management. I have toured the world - 200 cities in 61 countries - and I love to explore, travel, eat, cook and read.

Giving back to the community is important to me and our business is a ""Champion of Hope"" financial donor for a local men's shelter in Ottawa, Ontario. 

Hi! I'm Valerie, and have been living in Ottawa for most of my life. My professional background is international development with a focus on finance and project management. I have toured the world - 200 cities in 61 countries - and I love to explore, travel, eat, cook and read.  My very first trip was to Haiti and my latest expedition was a fabulous  South African safari.  I am also a Personal Travel Designer and I love both five star journeys and budget backpacking.  My favourite poem is Invictus,  and I would describe myself as lucky, blessed, happy, a foodie, an early adopter, endlessly curious,  the wife of Greg and the mother of two fabulous daughters - who are global citizens.

I never order food without checking with the locals for their faves and I rarely eat at chain food restaurants when there's a better local option. I would rather meet local people and get a sense of their community. I love to cook and with three kids & a husband to feed that's a good combination because boy, can they eat! Best vacations are family vacations. My teenagers still love to travel with us. I guess that says something about our travel adventures, and its a good thing! :) When we travel we make stops to see local curiosities and historic landmarks, often unplanned, screeching halt roadside and we pile out to check out a interesting relic or historic plaque/scene. I tidy a hotel room before I leave as if I was heading out of my own home and I tip the hotel staff. We love the theatre, live musical performances, animated kids movies, good local food and finding humour even in the worst of situations.
I love to meet new people and get to know them when I'm hosting, and I also respect their privacy or preference to be alone. I'm attentive to the guest's needs and like to accommodate as much as possible the guest's special requests.

I am excited to be a part of this community and to be able to help people feel right at home. 

I am originally from Oakville, Ontario, but I lived in Munich, Germany for a few years growing up. Being in Europe, so many great travel destinations were nearby, and this gave me a taste for travel and tourism! 

I moved to Ottawa to pursue an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Mechanical Engineering at the University of Ottawa in 2014, and have been here ever since. I'm now studying to obtain a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering. Becoming a host on Airbnb has been a great way for me to offset my tuition fees (thank you to all my past and future guests!).

I know what it's like to be a tourist in Ottawa, so I am happy to be a host here and to help guests make the most of their stay. I would be thrilled to be your next Airbnb host! :)",N/A,N/A,N/A,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/cc45759f-fbe8-4884-a998-2b342b264ea7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/cc45759f-fbe8-4884-a998-2b342b264ea7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Somerset,,45.41663,-75.69451,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,1,[],,8,28,8,8,1125,1125,8.0,1125.0,,,0,0,0,0,2023-12-18,66,0,0,2020-01-01,2022-10-28,4.98,4.98,4.95,4.98,4.97,4.98,4.92,STR-824-269,f,1,1,0,0,1.37

As a busy professional I know all about the need of a nice place where one can vacation and/or do business. Our home is clean and I would consider myself a tidy, hardworking and easygoing person.

I made Ottawa my home about a decade ago and have loved the balance this city provides. I have met people from different backgrounds and diverse nationalities ever since I moved here. 

I am a canadian public servant with a fascination to learn new languages and meet new people. I am also latina which is why when you don't find me working at the office I love teaching or taking a Zumba Class.

My favourite things include: traveling, politics, dancing and a good coffee/tea or glass of wine with the people I love!",N/A,N/A,100%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a02b753f-7a86-4bf0-ba2c-41178a85965c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a02b753f-7a86-4bf0-ba2c-41178a85965c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,3,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",Beacon Hill-Cyrville,,45.42523,-75.62598,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,1,[],$91.00,180,1125,180,180,1125,1125,180.0,1125.0,,t,0,14,44,319,2023-12-18,16,1,0,2020-12-06,2023-01-31,4.88,4.94,4.81,4.81,4.94,4.94,4.81,,f,1,1,0,0,0.43

My name is George and I am from Ottawa, Ontario. :) I am a recent engineering grad that loves to travel and explore new places. I have a stayed at a number of exquisite and modern Airbnb's in the past, that I decided to join the community with my own listing, right here in the Nation's Capital. 


Born and raised here in Ottawa, I know the city inside and out and will be more than glad to answer any of your questions. I recommend the following attractions for first time visitors in the city:


1.  Visit Parliament Hill 
2. Skate on the Canal Rideau during the winter 
3.  Visit the Museum of Nature and  the Canadian War Museum
4. Take a stroll and stop by for a bite to eat in the Byward Market
5. Visit Gatineau Park


Excited to be able to host you whether you're a new traveller to my Airbnb or a returning guest. :)

We're Sang and Mandy. We live by a simple principle: treat others with the same kindness and respect we wish to be treated with!

Whether it's as a host or a guest on Airbnb, that's a big part of our values in opening up our space and respecting others' own space and time. 

We've loved hosting family and friends over the years. So much that we've decided to share our home with others looking for a clean, comfortable and functional place to stay! 
If you have any questions about the home, we're more than happy to respond. 

On the flip side, we love traveling, exploring landscapes through hiking, and trying local eats! We know how much work maintaining a home requires.

So a little about me:
I've been living in Toronto for the past 7 years and don't plan on moving elsewhere for a long time.  I like to have family closeby... :)  BUT i'm a big traveller and I absolutely love to experience new cultures, landscapes, and people so i travel on average once a year. I've travelled mostly in the Latin American region and in the Middle East and can't wait to see more of the world.  Some of my favourite destinations: La Paz, Bolivia (I have never danced like I did that night!!!) and Cappadocia, Turkey (you gotta see it to believe it!).   When I travel, I am all about meeting locals.  I want to see a place through the eyes of the people that live there.  
That's why I love the concept of AirBnB - what's better than staying in an actual residence rather than a hotel? And better yet, having a chance to meet an airBnB host and learn about their city through their eyes and based on their experiences.  

As for my life in Toronto - I am currently doing my grad studies in Environmental Studies.  I am super passionate about the role of clean energy and energy efficiency in community economic development - particularly in lower income communities. I've been doing environmental and social justice work for many years and imagine I will be for most my life. 

What else? I'm an avid reader - I just finished the Millennium Trilogy by Stiegg Larson (think Girl with the Dragon Tatoo) - if you're into mystery/crime novels I would highly recommend this series! 

I like to cook lots - i've been trying to master some Persian dishes lately to make my mom proud, and I like to do active things - yoga, long walks, aerobics, etc.  Anything to counterbalance all those hours i'm forced to spend in front of a computer! 

If you were to host me, you'd find that I like a balance of doing things solo and also making my way around the city with some company.  I would like to meet the airbnb host I stay with, but I understand if they don't have much time to spend with their guests.  Essentially I adapt my travelling style based on the context.  I have travelled alone, in groups, in pairs, and i've stayed at hostels, with host families,  and bed and breakfasts.  Each experience is different, each host is different, so I think it's important to adapt as a traveller.  All I'm looking for is a clean place, and a friendly host I am depend on if there area any problems.  I am super independent and responsible so I promise to take good care of your place :)",N/A,N/A,N/A,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5005599/profile_pic/1360276162/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5005599/profile_pic/1360276162/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Rockcliffe - Manor Park,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Ottawa, Ontario, Canada",Rideau-Rockcliffe,,45.44402,-75.6428,Private room in condo,Private room,1,,1 private bath,,1,[],$98.00,180,250,180,180,250,250,180.0,250.0,,t,23,53,83,173,2023-12-18,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,f,1,0,1,0,

I used to be the CEO of a media start up company in China, and tired of the hustle and bustle of big city life. I followed my husband Qingwei to Ottawa, Canada and fell in love with the slow living lifestyle here.

Currently, Qingwei is a software engineer, and I am a stay-at-home mom and housing manager, and welcome you from all over the world is my most important job at the moment.


I am sharing with you a set of residences that I like very much. When I saw it at first glance, I couldn't help but want to own it. It is a house built in the 1950s. After several renovations, it became a place with exquisite and casual style. It has its own style and soul.

Here, you not only enjoy the convenience of the urban life circle, but also be completely close to nature! Sitting under the shade of the trees in the sun room reading a book and drinking coffee is my favorite thing to do every day. Whether you're on a business trip, busy with work, or someone who enjoys traveling, you'll love the relaxation here! This home will blow your tiredness away!

Everyone who has lived in the house will say it's great! Hope you all love it as much as I do!

A little about me, I was born and raised in Ottawa and I later moved to Toronto for studies. During my time there, I  worked in the service industry, then got into construction before finally settling in the real estate business. My parents are both from Argentina and Chile hence why I speak Spanish fluently and travelled many times to Brazil were I picked up Portuguese because of its similarities to French and Spanish. I love to travel and when I do, I almost always stay in Airbnb's . I find it to be the best way to discover a city, country or continent. I am a huge foodie so feel free to ask me for any recommendations :)

I am a full-time legal/tech analyst who enjoys living in a city with a blossoming music scene. I have been lucky enough to travel to some amazing places and blessed for having opportunity to meet with some wonderful people. 

As this quote says: ""A place is only as good as the people you know in it. It's the people that make the place."" by  Pittacus Lore. The people in a place bring it to life, and their personalities, values, and actions shape the culture and atmosphere of that location.

Now I slowed down my travels,  and instead developed a passion for being a host. I find great joy in meeting individuals from diverse backgrounds and exchanging stories with them.

I am open and accepting towards all individuals, regardless of where they are in their personal journey. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any inquiries or concerns regarding my listing.

I am a full-time legal/tech analyst who enjoys living in a city with a blossoming music scene. I have been lucky enough to travel to some amazing places and blessed for having opportunity to meet with some wonderful people. 

As this quote says: ""A place is only as good as the people you know in it. It's the people that make the place."" by  Pittacus Lore. The people in a place bring it to life, and their personalities, values, and actions shape the culture and atmosphere of that location.

Now I slowed down my travels,  and instead developed a passion for being a host. I find great joy in meeting individuals from diverse backgrounds and exchanging stories with them.

I am open and accepting towards all individuals, regardless of where they are in their personal journey. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any inquiries or concerns regarding my listing.

I consider myself a nature lover who enjoys hiking, biking, travelling, and the simple things life has to offer. Living with respect and care for all sentient beings is my philosophy of life. 

My formal education is in Business/Finance, Tourism, and Events. I have extensive experience in sustainable tourism and particularly in hospitality. As a proud Canadian I wish travellers get to experience and learn the natural attractions my country has to offer and that they make a genuine connection with our diverse culture. 

As a host, I will always give my best to make your guest experience as memorable and great as possible. Feel free to reach me anytime regarding your stay or any advice on tours or activities in the Toronto or Ottawa area, or throughout the country.

My formal education is in Business/Finance, Tourism, and Events. I have extensive experience in sustainable tourism and particularly in hospitality. As a proud Canadian I wish travellers get to experience and learn the natural attractions my country has to offer and that they make a genuine connection with our diverse culture. 

As a host, I will always give my best to make your guest experience as memorable and great as possible. Feel free to reach me anytime regarding your stay or any advice on tours or activities in the Toronto or Ottawa area, or throughout the country.

A little about me, I was born and raised in Ottawa and I later moved to Toronto for studies. During my time there, I  worked in the service industry, then got into construction before finally settling in the real estate business. My parents are both from Argentina and Chile hence why I speak Spanish fluently and travelled many times to Brazil were I picked up Portuguese because of its similarities to French and Spanish. I love to travel and when I do, I almost always stay in Airbnb's . I find it to be the best way to discover a city, country or continent. I am a huge foodie so feel free to ask me for any recommendations :)

I consider myself a nature lover who enjoys hiking, biking, travelling, and the simple things life has to offer. Living with respect and care for all sentient beings is my philosophy of life. 

My formal education is in Business/Finance, Tourism, and Events. I have extensive experience in sustainable tourism and particularly in hospitality. As a proud Canadian I wish travellers get to experience and learn the natural attractions my country has to offer and that they make a genuine connection with our diverse culture. 

As a host, I will always give my best to make your guest experience as memorable and great as possible. Feel free to reach me anytime regarding your stay or any advice on tours or activities in the Toronto or Ottawa area, or throughout the country.
